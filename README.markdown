# Concordance Kata

A kata started at the Edinburgh Code Dojo session on 5th October 2015.

The Kata was to write a program to generate a concordance for the Magna Carta, i.e. an alphabetically ordered list of words that appear in the text, along with the line numbers each appears on. We wrote it using TDD and pair programming, with rotating pairs over three pomodoros... and then I finished the solution off in my own time.

## Usage

	python concordancegenerator.py magna_carta.txt

You can replace `magna_carta.txt` with any text file to see how it gets on!
